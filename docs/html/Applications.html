<h2>Cryptocurrency</h2>

As long as speculative investors are willing to trade hard currency for shares in <a href="BlockchainBasics.html">blockchains</a>, <a href="SharesCoins.html">cryptocurrency</a> will be an interesting application.  Of course, the string of bits that makes up a blockchain isn't the really valuable part, it is the network of processors who make the blockchain extensible - alive if you will, that are the real value.  With active processors and a reliable (trustable) blockchain, investors today continue to invest with great enthusiasm.  May the bubble never burst.

<h2>Art Patronage</h2>

The world of digital art continues to struggle to inspire patrons to give digital artists the same level of backing that traditional painters, sculptors and other hard-media artists have enjoyed for centuries.  Conceivably, a digital work of art could be included a <a href="BlockchainBasics.html#GenesisBlock">Genesis Block</a> and patrons could purchase shares of the work.  Problems of counterfeiting and duplication still, of course, exist - but if the artist maintains the integrity of their digital signature that should be a somewhat reliable sign to investors that they are, indeed, purchasing a share of a genuine original work by the artist.  Shares in the work could be held openly, or anonymously, and similarly the amount paid for the shares would be optional to disclose.  Everyone, shareholder or not, would be free to enjoy the work, but only shareholders have "ownership" in the piece.  Pieces could be closely held, such as an image with a restriction to no more than 20 shareholders, or widely distributed like a song sold for $0.99 per share with 100 million shares available for purchase.
