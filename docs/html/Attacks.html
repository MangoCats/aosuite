A few attack ideas, by no means an exhaustive list.

<span itemprop="articleBody">

<h2><a name="Accumulation">Accumulation</a></h2>

In Accumulation attack, a bad actor slowly collects copies of valuable secret keys.  By collecting the copies slowly, in small increments, potentially spread out in different locations, suspicion is harder to place.  Nobody knows that their secrets have been copied, so they don't know that they are at risk of losing those secrets' value.<br/><br/>

Short <a href="Expiration.html">expiration</a> periods, and/or frequent trading for new shares can be effective deterrents against an accumulation attack.  High recording and assignment costs run counter to this defense, but a good balance should be possible.

<h2><a name="Replacement">Replacement</a></h2>

When an attacker has managed to compromise a server and replace AOR or AOV software with a malicious copy, then can't actually record invalid transactions, because invalid transactions are invalid on their face, the servers don't know the secret keys and therefore cannot manufacture fraudulent assignment records unless they also possess the secret keys, which are never sent to the server.  They can communicate with AOE/AOS software and pretend to record a transaction which they will later drop from the blockchain record, but that will quickly be discovered by alternate AOV servers and anyone who checks for the presence of the promised page in a block.<br/><br/>

Only software which handles secret keys has the potential to "steal" value, and while this does include AOE and AOS applications, AOI is probably the most vulnerable because it is usually setup to trade automatically.  A compromised AOI could behave normally until triggered remotely to suddenly sell low and/or buy high, depleting the owner's value by giving it away to other traders.<br/><br/>

Use of complete certified server images is one of the better defenses for all server operators, any vulnerabilities discovered can be quickly shared throughout the community.  Attempting to "dual purpose" a server to handle other duties like serving websites is inviting creative attackers like <a href="IslandLifeCharacters.html#Mal">Mal</a> to teach you an expensive lesson in network security.
