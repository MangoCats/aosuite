<span itemprop="articleBody">

A brief summary of what went on with each of the characters in <a href="IslandLife.html">Island Life</a>:

<h3>Alice</h3>
Alice used AOE to buy US$200 of CCC<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">Charlie's Cruise Credits</span></div> from Charlie.  Why?  Partly because of some insecurity Alice has about using her credit card in 13 ports in 14 days.<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">Like everyone else, Alice periodically has to change her credit card number because of fraudlent use - it's usually Albanians who are scamming on her card number, but that doesn't decrease her concern about the islands.  Even though she has a backup credit card, it would be unpleasant if one or especially both of her credit accounts had to be replaced for fraud concerns mid-cruise.</span></div>  AOE isn't a useable form of payment most places, but acceptance is growing, and the app helps Alice find things to do and make reservations more easily than trying to get islanders to answer a phone.<br/><br/>

Bob doesn't keep a regular schedule, he's usually at Eddie's when the launch lands at Sandy Ground, but not always, and sometimes when you arrive at Eddie's, Bob has run out of goat.  AOE told Alice not only that Bob was there<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">usually you can see the smoke from Bob's grill, or even the grill itself from the dock</span></div> but also that he had plenty of curry goat ready.  AOE let Alice "ping" Bob to let Bob know she's on her way.<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">Bob didn't used to carry a phone, but now that AOS helps him get paid he looks at it each time he accepts an AO payment, and there's a little indicator on AOS that tells him how many potential customers have "pinged" him to tell him they are on their way.  It's no contract requiring him to stay at the grill, but it does at least let him know that guests are probably coming his way.</span></div>  When Alice arrived, Bob had already set up her plate with a side of sugar apple.<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">Sugar apple isn't for everyone, but Alice is a hard character to forget and Bob remembers that she doesn't mind the seeds.</span></div>  AOE knew<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">by using the phone's GPS</span></div> Alice was at Eddie and Bob's place, so it presented her the menu of available choices there and also at the clothing store across the street: Island Threads.<br/><br/>

Alice selected one plate of Bob's Curry Goat on AOE and authorized payment of 1301 Albanian lek worth of CCC for it.<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">1301 lek is equivalent to US$12, and 12 CCC.<br/><br/>A little higher than she paid last year in cash, but getting that cash was a lot more than $2 worth of hassle.</span></div>  Bob's AOS was advertising a price of 1 BCG, Charlie's AOI was offering 1 BCG for 12 CCC, Alice's AOE had 135 CCC available<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">she had already spent 65 CCC on the Rainforest tour</span></div> so Alice's AOE assigned 12 CCC to Charlie's AOI in exchange for 1 BCG, then Alice's AOE assigned that 1 BCG to Bob's AOS<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">Actually, Bob's AOS created a key pair and told Alice's AOE the public key.  Alice's AOE proposed the assignment of 1 BCG to that public key and Bob's AOS accepted (by signing the assignment with the private key), this authorized assignment was recorded in Bob's blockchain, effectively placing ownership of that 1 BCG with the new private key that only Bob's AOS knows, so Bob "owns" it after the assignment is done and can assign it onward in the future, if he wants to.</span></div> and he thanked her for her patronage and handed her one plate of curry goat with sugar apple on the side.<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">The CCC trade is registered with Charlie's blockchain server, which he used to run from the ship but flaky onboard WiFi and Gene convinced him that running it and his AOI in a cloud instance would be more reliable for his guests.<br/>The BCG trade is registered with Bob's blockchain servers, hosted by Faythe and Gene.  Bob's AOS runs on his phone and verifies the receipt and non-double-spend of 1 BCG on his blockchain before indicating that the transaction is approved - it usually clears in under 15 seconds.<br/>Bob's AOS doesn't know what Alice paid for her CCC, but she shows Bob her phone screen which shows the price to Alice as 1301 Albanian lek.</span></div><br/><br/>

After she had a few drinks at Eddie's, Alice decided to check out Island Threads and she finds an adorable dress for EC$99.  Island Threads accepts CCC and ZIC directly as cash equivalent<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">with a small 3% service fee for CCC, 5% for ZIC</span></div> so the store's AOS proposes an assignment of 37.77 CCC<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">the CCC equivalent of EC$99 + 3%</span></div> which Alice's AOE shows her as 4092 Albanian lek worth of CCC, leaving her 12,484 lek remaining in CCC after the proposed assignment.  Alice authorizes the assignment, and wears her new dress as she leaves.<br/><br/>

By the time the Odyessy returns to Barbados, Alice only has 27.6842 CCC remaining in her AOE.  She forgets to cash them out with Charlie before she leaves the ship.  She has another cruise booked and Charlie will probably be there, if not she could try to settle with him over e-mail, but she's not really worried about 3000 lek.  On the next cruise, she buys 500 CCC and has about 120 left over at the end.  That time she did settle with Charlie in cash at the Purser's office on the last day.<br/><br/>

When Alice got home to Durrës, she showed her friend Yllka her AOE app and Yllka was so excited about it she started Yllka's crazy coffee club blockchain in her coffee shop.  Alice made a small initial 10 cup investment in YKK and watched her shares grow to over 1000 cups (at the expense of Yllka and other coffee club players, of course...) A few years later, Alice was dabbling with AO-Eye, planning her next cruise in the Caribbean, and she was surprised when a few hundred of her YKK shares unexpectedly sold at face value in exchange for BCG, ITC, DBR and several other island issues that Alice had put lowball bids on.  It turns out that Jonida, also from Durrës, had just been to the Caribbean and returned home holding a few hundred CCC.  Instead of trying to dig up Charlie to get cashed out, Jonida got on AOI and saw Alice's trade offers.  Jonida knows all about Yllka's crazy coffee club, so she traded her leftover Caribbean credits for some YKK that she could drink and exchange locally.

<h3>Bob</h3>
Bob broke the ice for small-business blockchain on the island.  For Bob, his blockchain got him some cash when he needed it, like a micro-loan, but instead of promising to repay cash, he promised plates of curry goat.<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">which basically only costs Bob what he pays for spices, plus his time and effort.</span></div>  Later on, when small-business blockchain started catching on, Bob was able to trade BCG for his spices, propane and even paper plates, and he could get cash more easily when he needed it in exchange for BCG instead of needing to find customers for his cooked goat.  Bob may not be a restaurateur with commercial real estate and a bunch of employees, but he does know what he is doing.  Bob has taken classes to learn about his trade, and has a good reputation with his customers.  Through his BCG blockchain, not only can Bob advertise all all of this, but his potential customers can verify what he claims, even before they set foot on the island.<br/><br/>

Bob uses the AOS<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">Assign Onward Seller</span></div> app which guides AOE<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">Assign Onward Explorer</span></div> app users to his current location, when he's open for business.  Bob still isn't thrilled about carrying a cellphone all the time, but Rita loves it.  At first, Bob only accepted BCG as payment.  Later, he set up an AO-Eye<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">aka AOI: Assign Onward Investor</span></div> which would sell BCG to anyone at any time, including when they were standing at his grill-cart.<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">just like Charlie did when Bob was starting out with BCG.</span></div> He set his own discount/premium rates for other issues, not only ZIC and CCC, but also DBR<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">Dave's Bike Rentals</span></div> and a few other local businesses that he trusted.  Bob never kept more than a couple thousand EC dollars in blockchain issues, but even that small investment paid good returns to him.<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">especially because Bob was very connected with what's going on on the island, so he only invested in businesses he knew to be reliable.</br>Outsiders often would come and invest in island blockchain issues and cut the margins between buy and sell, but most of them got burned eventually by taking small margins on businesses that were higher risk than they thought.</span></div>

<h3>Charlie</h3>
Charlie's CCC<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">Charlie's Cruise Credits</span></div> was one of the islands' first cash exchange issues.  Charlie pegged 1 CCC to US$1 and made his margins when he bought and sold issues like BCG.  Charlie did establish a 0.1 CCC transaction fee for every assignment recorded on the CCC blockchain, and he also limited automatic assignments to a max 1000 CCC per transaction.<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">The ship's Purser completely freaked out about how quickly Charlie might get into money trouble with the guests.  Charlie cut a deal with him that no transaction over US$1000 would take place without the Purser's direct approval.</span></div>  This limit effectively protects Charlie's pool of 1 million CCC from being stolen when Charlie isn't paying attention, only the small circulating share blocks can be assigned without explicit approval from Charlie and the ship's Purser, and when Charlie has a lot of small share blocks sitting in his AO, he can consolidate them to a block > 1000 CCC to put them back into protected status.<br/><br/>

After a few years, Charlie has accumulated several thousand "lost" CCC from guests who never redeemed it for cash.  The CCC sales agreement includes a 7 year expiration clause, but the cruise line strongly suggests that Charlie should make due dilligence to track down holders of outstanding shares to try to return their money to them.<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">they also cut Charlie in on cruise sales commissions if the CCC holders book a new cruise after he contacts them.</span></div>  Still, not everyone comes for another cruise, or responds to the e-mail address they bought the CCC under, so after 7 years their unspent CCC automatically transfer to Charlie's AO account.<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">This isn't the normal <a href="Expiration.html">expiration</a> mechnism, Charlie has his CCC blockchain set to a 10 year expiration period for shares that never get used.  This is "guest holdings" expiration which transfers back to Charlie's personal account.</span></div><br/><br/>

Charlie used to just make recommendations to guests about Bob and Eddie's place up the beach and a few other places around the islands, and in exchange Eddie and Bob would hook him up with free drinks and food when he'd show up.  Through selling CCC and redeeming via guests' AOE, he was able to more directly participate in the referral process, and also help his directionally challenged guests find the places they were looking for with their GPS.  People like Bob didn't have to trust Charlie to pay up for their CCC holdings, because Bob had already been paid for the BCG that Charlie's guests were offering.  People like Irene did choose to trust Charlie to make good on his CCC as cash, but sometimes Irene also offered ITC<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">Island Threads Coupon</span></div> specials where you could pre-buy 100 ITC for EC$80 and then spend those 100 ITC like cash at her store,<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">certain restrictions apply, coupons must be purchased a minimum of 72 hours before redemption, etc. etc.</span></div> Charlie knew some guests who were almost certain to go for this kind of deal, so he'd pre-purchase some ITC for EC$80 and then list them on AOI for EC$88 (actually, 32.60 CCC) when the coupons were ready to spend.

<h3>Dave</h3>
Dave rents bikes, mostly e-bikes these days.  When Bob wanted to put a motor on his cart, Dave put a custom 3KW mid-drive with hill climbing capability on for the cost of parts.<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">Not only are Dave and Bob friends, Bob also sends a lot of bike rental business Dave's way.</span></div>  Still, cost of those parts was EC$3000.  Dave's first foray into small business blockchain was investing in BCG, he let Bob pay him part of the cost of the motor in BCG.  Like Charlie, Dave turned around and sold those BCG for a profit, at first as a bulk sale to Ziggy and then more directly to guests through CCC and TCC.<br/><br/>

It wasn't long before Dave setup his own blockchain and offered DBR<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">Dave's Bike Rentals</span></div> on the open market: 1 DBR is good for a 1 hour e-bike rental, 2 DBR for 4 hours and 3 DBR for all day.<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">manual pedal bikes rent for half of the e-bike price.</span></div>  Dave normally charges US$29 per e-bike rental credit (US$68 for 4 hours, or US$87 for all day) but he put his DBR ask on the blockchain market<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">using AO-Eye</span></div> starting at US$25 per credit, increasing by US$0.02 per DBR "out on the market."  So anytime he has less than 200 DBR out, DBR are a discount compared to normal rental rates.<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">Eventually Charlie and Ted dropped their referral rate from 10% to 3% for Dave, and Ziggy set his referral rate for Dave at 2%, so guests holding CCC, TCC or ZIC will see DBR for sale at "market rate" + the current referral fee on whatever kind of credits they are holding.</span></div>  With the occasional exception, the market stabilized around 150 DBR out which gives Dave about US$4000 of extra cash to work with.  Dave is doing well before his blockchain issue, he doesn't need the cash, but having DBR "out there" on other people's accounts does drive more bike renters his way.  In kind, Dave holds about US$2000 worth of other good island businesses' issues and helps to promote them.

<h3>Eddie</h3>
Eddie was Bob's first investor.  For Eddie, shares of BCG were better than a cash loan because he could turn those shares back to the open market for cash faster than Bob would ever repay a loan.  Eddie mostly thought that Bob's grill-cart upgrade would keep Bob at Eddie's place more often, so he made the short term investment to help his bar business.  Eddie likes his cash, and he makes a lot of it.  Eddie was slower than most bars to accept blockchain as a form of payment, but eventually he saw how it was helping him indirectly through Bob and AOE,<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">and how some guests would go to other bars on Sandy Ground because they did accept payment through AOE</span></div> so he started accepting ZIC and CCC in season - sometimes for a premium for extra cash in his pocket, sometimes for a discount to try to draw business, until he eventually just settled on 1:1 exchange as good enough for everybody.<br/><br/>

Once in a while, Eddie would do another small placement offer like he did for Bob, but he never got into the whole AOI scene, he mostly settled up monthly with Charlie and Ziggy.  When Ziggy was paying 10% annual interest on ZIC he tried to talk Eddie into holding it instead of cashing it, but Eddie wasn't born yesterday.<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">even before Walter had his little chat in the limo with Ziggy, Eddie was telling Ziggy about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madoff_investment_scandal">Bernie Madoff</a></span></div>  He did get interest on the ZIC he held between settlements, but at the end of each month he gave Ziggy all of his ZIC back in exchange for a check that he cashed immediately.  Eddie never saw the point of setting up his own blockchain.

<h3>Faythe</h3>
When Gene first approached Faythe about hosting a blockchain server from her home, it sounded like fun.  She was helping small local businesses and really didn't have to do anything other than give up a tiny little piece of her closet and a couple of dollars a month in electricity and some internet bandwidth that she didn't even notice.  After the local paper did that story on island business blockchains, everybody wanted to talk with Faythe about it.  Faythe never thought she would issue a blockchain of her own.  She told the paper and everyone she met that Gene's old computer in her closet server was just a backup, Gene hosted the master copy in the cloud, she's just happy to be helping everyone.  But, that didn't stop Nick from thinking he could ransom her computer.<br/><br/>

After Nick broke into her house, Faythe didn't want to just stop running the backup.  The community came together, bought a new energy efficient silent computer and a lot of video surveilance equipment for Faythe's house.  They issued 10,000 FHC<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">Faythe's Hosting Credits</span></div> at a nominal price of EC$5, various donors purchased 1200 FHC which funded the new equipment and everyone who has a blockchain started giving Faythe 1 FHC per month as a hosting and backup fee.  Faythe offered the other FHC on the open market using the typical ramping price based on number of FHC outstanding, starting at EC$5 and increasing slowly as more FHC are outstanding in the market.  Faythe uses the ongoing proceeds to cover the cost of Gene's cloud hosting and they save the surplus for special projects.

<h3>Gene</h3>
Gene was the technical mastermind who got the blockchain back-end processes working for everyone on the island.  Basically, he just installed the Assign Onward Recorder (AOR) software and used the AOGenesis Maker to setup each blockchain issue.  AOR gets complicated pretty quickly when setting up multiple backups, Gene worked through all that and the AOR instances mostly take care of themselves now.<br/><br/>

Every so often Gene teaches a small blockchain usage course at the community college.  Gene also helps people get their genesis blocks configured appropriately for their use cases and gets them started using the AOS and AOI apps.  Before the break-in, Gene and Faythe stayed away from the AOI app, not wanting to have the appearance that they were making money off of everyone.  After the break-in, it became clear to everyone that there are some costs associated in hosting and they started paying for those costs by buying FHC from Faythe.  Gene setup an AOI to make a market in FHC and establish small holdings in the better issues from around the island, like 5-10 BCG, 2-3 DBR, etc.<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">These holdings, small as they are, give the issues some stability and liquidity.</span></div><br/><br/>

Gene likes mountain hiking, so sometimes he visits Hans in Saba.  Even though Hans' HSS doesn't circulate much on Bob's island, Bob and Hans setup a mutual backup arrangement, so now the island blockchains are stored a computer in Faythe's closet, another in Hans' villa on Saba, and the cloud copy.  In return, Hans' HSS are also mirrored on Bob's cloud instance and in Faythe's computer.

<h3>Hans</h3>
Hans lives in Saba, and he runs a cash exchange blockchain issue: HSS.<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">Hans' Saba Shares</span></div>  Hans has pegged 1 HSS = US$1.  At first HSS wasn't used for much, but over time Hans developed a reputation as a reliable conduit of funds between the Netherlands and Saba.  HSS doesn't circulate much with the tourists on Saba, except as a way to pay for lodging.  Hans accepts all kinds of currency and credit cards and forwards payment to the owners on the HSS blockchain with clear reporting of what property was paid for and when.  It has made the rentals market more transparent, which was more popular with the renters than the owners at first, but when occupancy went up the owners learned to like it too.  HSS doesn't get traded much at all outside Saba and people who visit Saba.

<h3>Irene</h3>
Owns Island Threads clothing store on Sandy Ground, accepts CCC and ZIC like cash.  Irene gets together with Charlie in April before the Odyessy leaves port and settles up face to face for the CCC she has collected.  Charlie usually writes Irene an ordinary bank check, which they electronically deposit while having drinks at Eddie's.

<h3>Jonida</h3>
Alice's new friend in Durrës, Albania.

<h3>Karen</h3>
Bob's daughter Karen helped Rita move her mangoes through her contacts at the hospital where Karen works as a nurse.  Before blockchain, Karen would basically bring bags of mangoes into work and hand them out to whoever said they wanted some.  Through talk about and sales of RMF, Karen was able to dig deeper and find resorts that were serious about the quality of their fruit.

<h3>Larry</h3>
A social engineer attacker.  Practically lives at the Lazy Lizard Lounge in the lobby of Long Bay Resort.

<h3>Mal</h3>
Network based attacker from the Middle East, location is uncertain but Mount Carmel Haifa is suspected.

<h3>Nick</h3>
A small time breaking and entering artist.

<h3>Oscar</h3>

<h3>Peter</h3>
When Ziggy's ZIC started taking off, he had a problem with being two places at once, so he took on a partner: Peter.  Ziggy handles the dock sales, customer service and business relations, Peter handles the money - both collection and refund at the docks, and bank transactions.  Peter's not exactly a saint, one day he tried pocketing $20 from a guest purchase of ZIC, but by the end of the day he and Ziggy got an e-mail from Victor pointing out the shortfall in the day's deposit.  Ziggy split the loss 50/50 with Peter, "everybody makes mistakes sometime" he said, so Peter came out ahead on his little experiment, but he also decided that his partnership with Ziggy is worth more.<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">A few months later, Peter really did make an honest mistake and come up $20 short, that time he made up the difference from his own money so he wouldn't trigger another notice from Victor.</span></div>

<h3>Quincy</h3>
The quant, works from his villa in Yodzonot, Quintana Roo.  Quincy tried applying his trading algorithms to the island blockchains, but met with limited success due to his lack of local knowledge and the small trading volumes.  After awhile he turned his capital to other more profitable uses.  Most of the island blockchains resist high frequency trading by setting fairly high recording fees.  Quincy entered the local markets by purchasing 1000 ZIC online with a credit card, and from there he let his algorithms identify the most profitable trading opportunities, which resulted in a narrowing of the bid-ask spread on most issues.  Quincy made moderate profits, but they were offset by occasional total losses when blockchains would shut down unexpectedly.  On-island investors like Bob and Dave had the inside track on when a particular blockchain might be shutting down, and Quincy taught his algorithms to look for signs of a selloff, but his algorithms could only follow, not lead those indicators.  Ultimately, the risk reward ratios were better elsewhere so Quincy executed an exit through Hans' HSS into more interesting European markets.

<h3>Rita</h3>
Bob's wife.  RMF: Rita's Mango Futures.

<h3>Sharon</h3>
Bob and Rita's daughter Sharon is a taxi driver.  Sharon didn't want to have anything to do with blockchain at first, but when guests started asking if they could pay through AOE she checked it out and saw how it could get her a little more from her fares.  Showing her location on AOE didn't hurt business any, either.  Sharon tried holding on to a few hundred ZIC while Ziggy was paying interest on it, better than bank rates and she didn't get burned, but "backed by Ziggy" certainly doesn't inspire confidence like the promises of a big bank does.

<h3>Ted</h3>
TCC: Ted's Caribbean Coin

<h3>Ursula</h3>
Ursula Unruh of Ulysses Kansas is a kind of ghost in the machine.  Nobody really remembers her, but she apparently took a cruise and bought several cash issues, then started trading through AOI without appearing in person.  e-mail sent to the address she stated: urunulysses@hushmail.com goes unanswered.  Most people believe she's an alias used by Quincy to get additional stake in the local markets.

<h3>Victor</h3>
Walter's forensic accountant.  Victor has setup automatic auditing for ZIC and a few other island issues.

<h3>Walter</h3>
A high-roller investment banker based on the island.  Probably due to his own big blockchain project, Walter has a strong interest in keeping the perception of integrity in island investments as good as it can be.

<h3>Xavier</h3>
Xavier Xiong of Xuancheng China, like Ursula, has been another bear to find in real life.  Although he listed an email address of xxxilin@163.com, he too is a ghost in the machine, mostly holding, rarely trading, when he does trade IP address do usually show his current location in mainland China.

<h3>Yllka</h3>
Owner of an Albanian coffee shop where Alice goes when she's not cruising.  KKY: Kreditë e kafesë Yllka.  Yllka has been selling coffee in Durrës for decades, and decided to try issuing blockchain based coffee coupons with a twist: a fixed 10,000 KKY credits divided among KKY shareholders, but whenever a KKY credit is traded, 10% of its associated shares are expired - so, holders of shares in KKY all get a 1/100,000 boost in their credit holdings for every KKY credit traded.  If a KKY is bought and then redeemed, that's 2 trades, 20% loss to the trader, but, Yllka introduced KKY to the market at 25% off face value, so just doing a purchase directly through KKY results in a 5% discount.<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">and, since initially Yllka is holding most of the credits/shares, she receives most of the benefit from the share expirations.</span></div>  For every 70,000 YKK transactions, holders of YKK will see their credits double.  Yllka sells an average of more than 200 coffees a day and each coffee sold represents a minimum of 2 transactions: 1 buy and 1 sell, so 70,000 transactions happen roughly every 6 months, if everyone buying coffee uses YKK.  Yllka set a price ramp based on YKK outstanding so that customers get a 5% discount when all shares are outstanding, no discount when half the shares are outstanding, and pay a 5% premium when zero shares are outstanding - as more customers are holding YKK instead of immediately redeeming it for coffee, the discount goes down, and presumably the number of YKK transactions goes down, reducing returns and finding some equilibrium point with Yllka holding approximately 5000 YKK and the other half held by investor-customers.  There's no money being "created" here, it's just sharing income with the investors.  YKK is only redeemable through Yllka for coffee, or to other investors.  It's basically a fun coupon game for her customers.<br/><br/>

So, if a customer "invests" in 10 YKK and holds them for 5 years, what's happening there?  5 years could be 10 doublings of the shares, effectively this investor will corner the market, right?  Well, as the total of all investor's holdings start to exceed 5000 YKK, the universal use of YKK should diminish considerably because Yllka is raising the price to a point where it's cheaper to not buy and use YKK.  As that use of YKK drops, return diminishes, investors likely sell or drink their YKK and the growth market picks up again.  There is a danger that the investors put a run on YKK and Yllka gets no cash for her next ~5000 cups of coffee, almost a month's worth, but remember that Yllka received money for YKK up front, so that should compensate for the wind-down costs.  One or two early investors might drink free coffee for life at Yllka's, but their cups are being paid for by the discount that Yllka is giving on YKK.  Then there's also the fact that Yllka has put a 1 year <a href="Expiration.html">expiration</a> on YKK, so share holders need to trade their shares (and pay a 10% exchange tax to all other share holders even if they trade their shares to themselves) at least once every year, so even though the big shareholders still drink for free, there is plenty of froth in the mix to keep things interesting for other players.
