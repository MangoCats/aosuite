<span itemprop="articleBody">The basic assignment protocol ensures that all parties to an assignment are in agreement with the terms before the assignment can be recorded to the blockchain.  However, what protocol can assure that all parties are in agreement about a multi-chain assignment and that the assignment has been recorded in all blockchains before taking effect in any of them?  For example: <a href="IslandLifeCharacters.html">Alice</a> holds 135 CCC.  Charlie is advertising that he will exchange 12 CCC for 1 BCG.  Alice wants to give Bob 1 BCG.  What needs to happen?<br/><br/>

The simplest situation would involve trust among the parties: Alice assigns 12 CCC to Charlie and Charlie assigns 1 BCG to Bob, separate assignments on separate blockchains, if they both are recorded everybody is happy.  However, if either assignment fails to be recorded<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">failure to record could be a simple technical error, or it could be a malicious attempt to cheat.</span></div> then either Bob or Charlie will be unhappy when they discover the missing assignment in the permanent blockchain record.  The parties could all get copies of the authorized assignments which would be their proof that the transaction was authorized, but if those same shares are recorded in the blockchain as transferred to another key before this authorized assignment is recorded, then this assignment will be invalidated.<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">the same shares cannot be assigned twice.</span></div><br/><br/>

What can happen are conditional assignments in both chains.  The shares in question are escrowed for a period of time, and if proof of all required recordings is recorded<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">Even a late proof of all required recordings can still be binding, as long as none of the source shares have been invalidated by assignment elsewhere.</span></div> then the assignment becomes binding.  It doesn't sound simple, and it's not, especially when more than 2 blockchains are involved.  First, even before starting CAA<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">Conditional Assignment Agreement</span></div> recording, all concerned asset organizer applications should "ping" all concerned blockchain recorders to ensure they are available to record assignments.  Next, the complete exchange is described in a CAA and approved by all parties giving and receiving shares in all chains.  Then, this CAA is recorded in every concerned blockchain, Ouroboros style.  What this means is: the concerned blockchains are given a numerical order in the CAA.  When the CAA is recorded on the first blockchain<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">For practical purposes, after initial recording of a CAA the escrow period gets extended to provide a reasonable interval for recording of the binding CAA in all chains.</span></div> the signature of that block (proof of recording) is appended to the CAA and the extended CAA is recorded on the next blockchain.  While there are additional blockchains involved, the CAA is recorded on each and the proof of recording is appended to the CAA.  Finally, when the CAA is recorded on the last blockchain with proof of recording on all other concerned blockchains, and before the escrow period has expired, that recording makes the CAA binding.  Still, this binding recording also needs to be recorded to all other concerned blockchains, and so the recording block signature of the binding CAA is appended to the CAA and that completed (binding) CAA is recorded in all other concerned blockchains, binding the transaction in each chain as it is recorded.  The process requires two recordings in all concerned blockchains, and a third recording in all but one concerned blockchains.  For a three party two chain assignment it's not too bad, it breaks down like this:<br/><br/>

    <li>Alice's AOE proposes a CAA to Bob's AOS and Charlie's AOI<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">recording fees neglected for simplicity of presentation, some small fraction of the CCC and BCG would be given to the recording servers during the transaction to cover recording costs (aka SPAM reduction fees.)</span></div>:</li>

    </ul>
    <li>Alice's AOE sends the (unsigned) CAA to Charlie's AOI and Bob's AOS for informal agreement</li>
    <li>Charlie's AOI receives Alice's CAA, which constitutes a BID of 12 CCC for 1 BCG, from his perspective</li>

    <li>Bob's AOS sends the signed CAA to Alice and Charlie.</li>

    <li>Charlie's AOI indicates new balances of CCC and BCG<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">onscreen if Charlie is looking, more often Charlie is not looking.</span></div>, potentially adjusting affected BID ASK prices and perhaps initiating some other trades</li>
</ol>

Key points: 

<ul><li>Until Bob places the final signature on the CAA it has no binding effect.  Only when all givers and receivers of shares in the CAA have signed it is it ready for recording.</li>
    <ul><li>However, when Alice and Charlie sign the CAA, it is then out of their hands whether or not Bob will sign.  They must act as if Bob will sign and the CAA will be recorded until the escrow period has expired.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>When the CAA is first recorded on a blockchain, it places the "give" shares in escrow for the agreed period of time on that blockchain.</li>
    <li>The "conditional" part of a CAA is that the CAA is not binding unless and until it has been recorded on all concerned blockchains before the escrow expiration time.</li>
    <ul><li>Considered and rejected: The CAA may have a two stage escrow period.  Stage one expires if the CAA has not been recorded on a chain, and stage two expires later if a CAA has not become binding by stage two expiration time.  This allows a party to the CAA to sign the CAA but only commit to the stage one lockup period unless all other parties also sign and start the recording process.  Stage two allows a longer period of time to execute all the AOR recordings.  Rejected because once a party has signed a CAA, they have no control over whether or not other parties will sign and record the CAA, so they are subject to the Stage two escrow period, regardless.  Should strike all references to this two stage escrow period... later.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Once the last blockchain has recorded a copy of the CAA and all recordings were made before the escrow expiration, the CAA then becomes binding on all chains, however...</li>
    <li>Chains which do not have a fully validated CAA recorded on them are still in limbo until one of two things happen:</li>
    <ul><li>A copy of a fully validated CAA is recorded on the chain, closing the CAA as validated.</li>
        <li>A refutation of the CAA is recorded on the chain, including a copy of a post escrow expiration from at least one other chain in the CAA which did not record the CAA before the escrow expiration deadline.  This invalidates the CAA and frees the "give" shares in it to be given in other assignments.  Note, again, that this refutation cannot be recorded until after the escrow period has expired.<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">Polite transaction processing software will not leave CAAs in limbo.  There is a potential hack here where a CAA might point to a defunct chain with unreachable recording servers and malicious actors can "lock up" shares on active chains by putting them under a CAA with such a chain - such shares will eventually <a href="Expiration.html">expire</a>.  As a partial mitigation this is why all participants ping all recording servers before authorizing a CAA.</span></div></li>
    </ul>
    <li>Once a CAA is fully validated on a blockchain, receivers of shares in that CAA (on that chain) are then free to assign those shares onward, even if the escrow period has not yet expired.</li>
    <li>In the above example, Alice's AOE is "driving the transaction" through the blockchains' AOR servers by virtue of having proposed the transaction in the first place... it may be preferable for the more stable<div class="tooltip"><sup>*</sup><span class="tooltiptext">by virtue of being run by vendors instead of transient guests</span></div> AOS software to take charge of the AOR interface aspects.</li>
